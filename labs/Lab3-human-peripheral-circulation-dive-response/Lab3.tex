\section{Background: Blood pressure and peripheral
circulation}\label{background-blood-pressure-and-peripheral-circulation}}

Vertebrates have a \textbf{closed circulatory system} where the blood is
always enclosed within blood vessels or the heart. Blood is pumped from
the \textbf{heart} (the central pump) to the \textbf{vasculature}: the
\textbf{arteries}, \textbf{capillary beds} (sites of delivery to
tissues), \textbf{the veins}, and back to heart. There are several
important consequences of this design: (1) blood pressure varies across
species according to oxygen demand and morphology (especially animal
height), (2) \textbf{blood pressure varies along the circuit}, (3)
\textbf{blood pressure can be regulated at points along the circuit},
and (4) \textbf{blood pressure can be modified situationally} depending
the state of the animal.

\hypertarget{blood-pressure-varies-across-species}{%
\subsubsection{Blood pressure varies across
species}\label{blood-pressure-varies-across-species}}

For \textbf{very active} animals (e.g., mammals and birds) or
\textbf{very large animals} (especially very tall animals that have more
gravity to resist), the ability to regulate blood pressure is critical
--- active animals will \emph{need more oxygen delivered at a faster
rate}, especially to the most metabolically active tissues, and
\emph{larger animals will require much more pressure} to reach all of
their tissues.

\hypertarget{blood-pressure-varies-during-the-cardiac-cycle.}{%
\subsubsection{Blood pressure varies during the cardiac
cycle.}\label{blood-pressure-varies-during-the-cardiac-cycle.}}

The \textbf{cardiac cycle} is a complete cycle of the heart beat,
comprised of \textbf{systole} (Figure~\ref{fig-systole}; the phase
involving contraction and ejection) and \textbf{diastole}
(Figure~\ref{fig-diastole}; relaxation and filling) of the atria and
ventricles. We will learn more about the cardiac cycle in the EKG lab.
In this lab we are focusing on the blood pressure changes. The largest
muscles of the heart are in the \textbf{ventricles}. Blood pressure is
at its highest immediately after the ventricles contract to push blood
into the arterial system (Figure~\ref{fig-wiggers}; \textbf{systolic
pressure}) and declines as the ventricles relax to fill with blood
before pumping again. Just before the ventricles contract, blood
pressure is at its lowest (\textbf{diastolic pressure}).

\hypertarget{blood-pressure-varies-along-the-vascular-circuit.}{%
\subsubsection{Blood pressure varies along the vascular
circuit.}\label{blood-pressure-varies-along-the-vascular-circuit.}}

Blood in the arteries leaving the heart is always at very high pressure
as compared to the low pressure in the veins in the legs or the even
lower pressure in capillary beds at the tissues. Blood pressure drops as
the blood vessels branch again and again, increasing the cross-sectional
area of the circuit, until it reaches the capillaries where the tissues
experience relatively constant, low pressure to facilitate
\textbf{diffusion}.

The slow blood flow at the capillaries facilitates diffusion of oxygen,
nutrients, and carbon dioxide and other wastes between the blood and the
tissues that are bathed by the capillaries. Therefore, \textbf{pressure
varies} depending on \textbf{distance from the heart}, the
\textbf{cross-sectional area of the blood vessels}, as well as
\textbf{gravity}. However, at any given point along the circuit, blood
pressure remains fairly constant.

\hypertarget{circulation-can-be-adjusted-situationally.}{%
\subsubsection{Circulation can be adjusted
situationally.}\label{circulation-can-be-adjusted-situationally.}}

At most times, blood pressure is regulated to \textbf{maintain a
relatively constant pressure}, however, there are times when
\textbf{circulation needs to be adjusted}. A well-known example is the
\textbf{Fight-or-Flight response}, which occurs, for example, when an
animal sees a predator or anticipates a fight. The \textbf{sympathetic
nervous system} dominates and causes a ramp-up of circulation to deliver
more energy to the skeletal muscles: increased \textbf{cardiac output}
(= \textbf{heart rate} x \textbf{stroke volume}) and \textbf{blood
pressure}, and increased blood flow to the lungs and skeletal muscles.
In contrast, the \textbf{rest-and-digest} response occurs after an
animal has had a large meal. The \textbf{parasympathetic nervous system}
dominates, lowering heart rate, concentrates blood flow to the gut, and
promotes a resting state.

Adjustments to blood flow are not simply an adjustment of heart
function, but also \textbf{constriction or relaxation of the
vasculature} (blood vessels: arteries, veins, capillaries).
\textbf{Constricting blood vessels} will reduce their
\textbf{cross-sectional area} and \textbf{increase blood pressure and
flow}.

Local changes in circulation are under \textbf{nervous} and
\textbf{hormonal} control. Regulation of blood flow in the vertebrate
circulatory system occurs by three primary mechanisms: 1) \textbf{local
receptors} (\emph{nervous system}) to detect levels of metabolic
activity (e.g., carbon dioxide receptors), 2) \textbf{sympathetic} and
\textbf{parasympathetic} (\emph{autonomic nervous system}) control of
the vasculature including capillary beds at the tissues, and 3)
\textbf{endocrine} (\emph{hormonal}) control of the vasculature.

In this lab, we will measure blood pressure of volunteers using a finger
pulse transducer, a stethoscope, a blood pressure cuff
(sphygnomanometer), and changes in peripheral circulation by measuring
the volume of the extremities using a belt with a force transducer. We
will do a series of learning exercises and then conduct an experiment on
factors affecting peripheral circulation and as well as during simulated
dives (the dive response).

Pressure}\label{exercise-1-measuring-blood-pressure}}

Traditionally, systemic arterial blood pressure is measured using a
\textbf{stethoscope} and a \textbf{blood pressure cuff} connected to a
blood pressure gauge called a \textbf{sphygnomanometer}
(\emph{sss-fig-no-ma-nom-eter}). The sphygnomanometer is calibrated in
pressure units of mmHg (millimeters of mercury). Modern instruments use
compressed air as a hydraulic fluid to transmit the force of your
pulsing blood.

Refer to {[}\href{../Protocols/p2-measuring-blood-pressure.pdf}{Protocol

\hypertarget{exercise-3-the-dive-response}{%
\section{Exercise 3: The Dive
Response}\label{exercise-3-the-dive-response}}

When an air-breathing animal dives, it voluntarily holds its breath
while the tissues continue to use oxygen. The \textbf{dive response} is
a reflexive response that reorganizes circulation to maintain blood flow
to the most essential organs -- the brain, eyes, and myocardium (heart
muscle), while reducing blood flow to the peripheral tissues including
musculature of the limbs and thorax, lungs, and renal system.
Remarkably, all vertebrates have a dive response. The responses vary
greatly between taxa, with some of the most pronounced being in whales
and diving seals.

Primary features of the human \textbf{dive response} are the rapid onset
of \textbf{bradycardia} (slowing of the \emph{heart rate}), which works
together with \textbf{peripheral vasoconstriction} to shunt blood toward
the bodyʻs core. This causes an increase in the volume of blood
returning to the \textbf{heart} and an increase in \textbf{stroke
volume}. These in turn cause an increase in \textbf{arterial blood
pressure}. To counteract this increase in blood pressure and reduce
overall blood flow, there is a \emph{drop in heart rate}.

As a whole, the dive response preserves circulation around the vital
organs while reducing circulation to the peripheral tissues. Oxygen
becomes depleted and carbon dioxide and lactate build up in the tissues
during a dive. When the animal resurfaces, there is a recovery period
characterized by more rapid heart rate and ventilation to absorb more
oxygen and flush out lactate and carbon dioxide.

The dive response is triggered by sudden submergence of the face in cold
water, which stimulates the \emph{trigeminal nerve receptors} around the
nose. Stimulation is enhanced with colder temperature, which inhibits
the cardiovascular center, as well as increasing parasympathetic output
and reducing sympathetic output, both of which reduce heart rate.

\hypertarget{objectives-1}{%
\subsection{Objectives}\label{objectives-1}}

You will investigate the effects of the diving response on heart rate
and peripheral circulation in humans during simulated dives. First, you
will examine the effect of holding your breath, then you will examine
the effects of simulated dives, and an experiment to determine which
stimuli contribute to triggering the dive response. One person will
serve as the experimental subject.

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  Switch the PowerLab to the Dive Response settings. You should have the
  Finger Pulse transducer in channel 1 and the Respiratory Belt
  Transducer to input 2 to measure leg volume. Check the channel
  settings to make sure they match the inputs. Ask your TA for the
  proper settings. In this experiment, the sphygnamanometer is used to
  pressurize the thigh and not plugged in to PowerLab.
\item
  Set up and maintain a wash basin with icewater deep enough to submerge
  your face up to your temples. Use a thermometer to monitor temperature
  at 10-15C (50-60F), replenish with ice as needed.
\item
  Attach the respiratory belt snugly to the calf
  (Figure~\ref{fig-calf}). \emph{It should feel tight and the sensor
  fabric should be slightly stretched.}
\item
  Place the sphygnomanometer cuff around the subject's thigh, and
  \emph{duct tape it securely so that it can be pressurized to restrict
  blood flow}. Be sure to apply tape to \emph{secure both the top and
  the bottom} of the cuff.
\item
  Record for 10 seconds and stop. Scale the Pulse channel and the Leg
  Volume channel to fully display the data.
\item
  Record again and test by flexing and relaxing your calf. \emph{You
  should be able to see a clear deflection on the leg volume channel.}
  If it is very small, try tightening the respiratory belt a little.
  Check with your TA before moving on.
\item
  For all experiments, \emph{resting position for the subject is leaning
  over the basin with the face just aboe water.}
\item
  Use a timer to time the treatments (a cell phone or a web browser will
  do).

We can quantify the volume in your peripheral circulation (specifically
your lower leg) by assessing \textbf{venous pooling} for a standard time
interval. By constricting blood flow to the lower limb, we will prevent
venous return of the blood. Because the veins have little smooth muscle,
it is relatively easy to stop venous return.

You will use the sphygnomanometer cuff to cut off circulation in the leg
